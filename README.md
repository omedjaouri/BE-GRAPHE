# BE-GRAPHE

Project for class worked on while in France.

Steps
   1) Use the Graphe class provided to reconstruct the map using 
      your own classes for the Nodes, Edges, and Paths of the graph
   2) Implement pathfinding using Dijkstra and Dijkstra + Astar
   3) Implement tests for pathfinding algorithms
   4) Implement Ride-Sharing:
               O1 = Starting point for car
               O2 = Startig point for person
               D = destination
               M = meeting point for car and person
               Goal = Minimize total distance traveled 
               Function = (O1 -> M) + (O2 -> M) + 2(M -> D)
